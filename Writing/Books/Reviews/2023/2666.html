        Bolano's book is separated into five fairly lengthy sections, so I'm going to also separate my thoughts similarly. That way I can write as a go along.
        <h4>Book 1</h4>
        This first book here introduces us to 4 literary critics who are obsessed with a particular reclusive German author, Archimboldi. The story introduces their backstories, their involvement with Archimboldi, and their eventual entanglement. Here, Bolano sticks out to me as an unabashed teller of stories and fairly frank in his narrative approach, allowing the story to unfold without leading the reader along. His (or the translator's) prose is at once plain (never becoming flowery for too long), poetic (articulate placement of words), textured (there seems to be a sloppy cadence to everything), and rich (dense with information). The story unfolds in a way which reminds me of Marquez, always playing with the reader's expectations and being willing to expand or shy away from different parts of the story for dramatic affect. A steady narrator is also something which Bolano seems to ape, in this case from Sebald, with his meandering from story to story, town to town, dream to dream. 
        </br>
        So far and throughout this first book, Bolano's emphasis on dreams seems to be a primary theme that runs through his world. So while his world seems a materialistic one, at least from the reader's point of view the images found in the numerous dreams and encounters seem to spill out. A dream in which Bolano spends time describing the arm of a statue might be followed within the next 10 or so pages by the word arm. Not something which sounds threatening at first, but these links are frequent enough that there's clearly some psychological film tying these characters, pages, words together beyond the linear walk from page to page. Another similar dynamic can be explained by analyzing the following sentence:
        <p style="padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em;">
            [...] they dug up the barbecue, and a small of meat and hot earth spread over teh patio in a thin curtain of smoke that enveloped them all like the fog that drifts before a murder and vanished mysteriously as the women carried the plates to the table leaving clothing and skin impregnated with its aroma.
        </p>
        This sentence shows up after they're in mexico and have heard about the missing/murdered women. The particular situation, however, has little to do with the murders, but this violence is injected here and other places through the later portion of book one. And although by the end of book one no real violence has taken place, these hints of violence can be seen as some other "off screen" character's dream bleeding into the narrative. This rotting of the very walls the reader has come to depend upon has a unnerving and often revolting way of bring this violence closer to the reader who's let their guard down.
        </br>
        The love triangle (or love square?!?) that developes between the critics is the main engine through this first part of the story and I couldn't help but feel a little cheated by the cliche, but Bolano does his best to spice things up. The two male, non-crippled critics fall in love with the female critic and they slowly become each other. Perhaps symbolic of Spain and France's relationship, perhaps not, but either way it provides a psychological depth to the drama which is furthered by the protagonists' academic Man Without Qualities-esc ambivalence. They all seem like something out of a Houellebecq novel: smart, book-y, Nietzschian. Sometimes your eyes would roll out of your head if they weren't so cute chasing Archimboldi around.
        </br>
        While you'll have to look beyond skin deep for an obvious philosophical message, it's clear that Bolano has mystery and ambiguity in mind. The reader doesn't know what's going to happen, neither do the characters, and I'm going to guess that our wise authors, Archimboldi and Bolano (rip), don't know either. More concretely, the visual artists the critics become interested by and travel to meet in the asylum holds an air of unknowableness. Why did he die? Why did he cut off his hand? Why is he in an asylum? Bolano likes to end chapters like this too, with several questions in a row.
        </br>
        There's also a lot to say about identity and race everyone of these characters and Bolano makes known the race of most every character's nationality. This introduces some level of paranoid conspiracy, a la pynchon, in addition to calling into question the nature of authenticity and the problem of alienation, both within and outside your own country. I know this'll be a continued theme.
        <h4>Book 2</h4>
